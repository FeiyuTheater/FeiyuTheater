// Warning: the above front matter tells Jekyll to process this file, do not delete even if it's empty.

// Tips:
// Only include other scss files in this file
// Try to avoid adding any styles directly here
// We should only add styles in the `_sass` directory, and then import them here
// For example, @import "base/variables" to import `_sass/base/variables.scss`

// Base
@use "base/base";

// Components
@use "components/banner";
@use "components/footer";
